![A picture of me](/public/images/profile.jpeg "A picture of me")

Hi, my name is Eirik Mildestveit Hammerstad. I'm a software engineer, located in Trondheim, Norway. By day i work as a software consultant / .NET developer at Sopra Steria Norway.

On this site I write down some of my thoughts on software development, and quite possibly some other things. If anything on this page helps you out in any way, know that it makes me very happy. And surprised.

I also maintain a [Github](https://github.com/hammerstad) account, where the code I write in my spare time come to die.

Thanks for reading!
